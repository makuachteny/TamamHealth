/**
 * The appointment status dropdown — the front desk's whole ladder in one
 * control: Scheduled, Reminder Sent, Confirmed, Arrived, Checked In, Roomed,
 * Checked Out, then the exits (No Show, Rescheduled, Cancelled).
 *
 * Shared so the front desk, the appointments list and the chart all offer the
 * same options in the same order — the drift this replaces had one surface
 * calling a rung "In Progress" while another called it "Roomed", and two
 * surfaces offering no way to set most rungs at all.
 *
 * Options and order come from `APPOINTMENT_STATUS_OPTIONS`. A status not on
 * that list (`requested`, written by the patient portal) is still shown while
 * it is the current value, so the control never misreports where a booking is.
 *
 * Permission is the caller's job, not this component's: it doesn't know which
 * role is driving it, so it can't decide who may reach `cancelled` versus who
 * may only advance the ladder. Pass `allowedStatuses` to narrow the list (the
 * current value always stays visible even if it's outside that list, same as
 * the `requested` handling above); omit it to offer the full ladder.
