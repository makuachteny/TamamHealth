/**
 * Turn the registration form into the patient document that gets saved.
 *
 * Pure mapping, kept out of the component so the field-by-field translation
 * can be read and tested without rendering a form or mocking a database — it
 * was a 55-line object literal in the middle of an async submit handler,
 * which is the last place anyone looks for "what do we actually store".
 *
 * Normalizes phones, the national ID and the email on the way through.
 * `patient-service` normalizes again on write; doing it here as well keeps the
 * value we hand over identical to the value that lands, so the review the
 * clerk just confirmed is the record that gets created.
