/**
 * Monotonic per-database document counter (KAN-54 / MED-05).
 *
 * Generalised from `patient-service.nextHospitalSequence()`, which replaced a
 * `db.allDocs().total_rows` count for the same reasons that apply to invoice
 * and bill numbers:
 *
 *   1. **O(N) on every allocation.** `allDocs()` walks the whole database just
 *      to learn how many rows it holds. At 10,000 invoices that is a full scan
 *      on every single billing action.
 *
 *   2. **Numbers get reused.** This is the serious one. `total_rows` falls when
 *      a document is deleted, so the next allocation reissues an identifier
 *      that already belongs to a different record. A duplicate invoice number
 *      is a financial-integrity problem: two distinct bills that reconcile to
 *      the same reference, and a payment that could be matched to either.
 *
 * `_local/` documents are deliberate: they are NOT replicated, so each facility
 * node keeps its own sequence and two nodes can never fight over the same
 * counter revision. Identifiers are already namespaced (by facility prefix or
 * by date), so per-node counters are the correct model. The trade-off is that
 * two facilities can mint the same sequence — acceptable because the namespace
 * differs, and far better than a replicated counter whose conflicts would need
 * resolving on every write.
