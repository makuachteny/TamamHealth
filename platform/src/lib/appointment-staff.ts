/**
 * What a provider/staff dropdown has to say about each person before someone
 * can sensibly assign a visit to them.
 *
 * A list of bare names cannot answer the questions actually being asked at the
 * moment of assignment — is this the right kind of clinician, are they even
 * free at this time, and how loaded is their day already? Reception was picking
 * a name and only discovering the clash after saving, which is how a booking
 * ends up double-stacked on one doctor while a colleague sits empty.
 *
 * So each option carries: who they are (role/specialty and department), whether
 * they are free at the slot being edited, and how many visits they already hold
 * that day. `<option>` renders text only, so this is a formatted string rather
 * than markup — kept here, and unit-testable, instead of inline in two files.
