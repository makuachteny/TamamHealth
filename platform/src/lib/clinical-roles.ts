 * TRAINEE_AUTHOR_ROLES, so `isProviderRole('clinical_officer')` was false and CO
 * notes routed for co-signature — while every API guard, `permissions.ts` and
 * `role-display.ts` PHYSICIAN_ROLES already treated a CO as an autonomous
 * prescriber equal to a doctor. Signing was the only place that disagreed.
 *
 * The asymmetry was untenable in both directions: a clinician trusted to
 * prescribe unsupervised but not to sign their own note either has the wrong
 * prescribing rights or the wrong signing rights. Confirmed as independent —
 * which also reflects South Sudan staffing, where a CO is frequently the most
 * senior clinician at a PHCU or PHCC and no doctor is posted to co-sign.
